Hi there, If you see this GitHub account, it means there is an issue with my main account, but don't worry as the code is still being updated here, just a bit less frequently. I will soon update my main account and code on this account.

# Website charity

This is a basic website about Spring Core with Hibernate technology using JSP.




## Knowledges

 - Spring MVC (Model View Controller).
 - Hibernate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).   
 - Spring Session (HttpSession).
 - Get infomations from a Urls / Form (head - body).



## Description

In the project, there are only 2 distinct roles:  Admin and User.


This project does not use Spring Security, so it will use HttpSession to manage access rights for each user.

  
  ADIMN :

    - An admin can create posts for funds in need of support.
    - An admin can create users and choose roles for themselves.
    - An Admin can approve and cancel the amount of money that the user has supported.
    - Find user(s) or post(s) by key words

   USER :
   
    - Users can register an account. 
    - They can access posts without logging in. 
    - After logging in, they can support an amount for a post.

Apart from the project using Spring Core along with Hibernate and JSP, I also have a similar project using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf with similar features, but without writing too much under the Repository layer.
